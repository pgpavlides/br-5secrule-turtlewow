# FiveSecondRule
A Turtle WoW addon for mana classes that tracks the five-second rule (FSR or 5SR), mana ticks (MP5), mana consumption, and mana gains.

This is a simple, lightweight, and elegant addon for TurtleWoW that tracks the "five-second rule" countdown, "ticks", mana gained and mana consumed. A small vertical line, or "spark", moves horizontally across the mana bar. When moving right-to-left, it is counting down the "five-second rule". When moving left-to-right, it times each "tick". Any mana consumed or gained is displayed to the right of the mana bar and fades out, similar to floating combat text.

<h4>Features</h4>

- Tracks the "five-second-rule"* (FSR or 5SR) countdown as movement right-to-left
- Tracks mana "ticks"** as movement left-to-right
- Displays any mana gains as light blue text to the right of the mana bar as "+50"
- Displays any mana consumption as deep purple text to the right of the mana bar as "-50"
- Simple, lightweight, elegant, and compatible with the default UI
- Compatible with [TheLinuxITGuy](https://github.com/TheLinuxITGuy)'s beautiful [Turtle Dragonflight UI](https://github.com/TheLinuxITGuy/Turtle-Dragonflight)

<h4>Vocabulary</h4>

- *The "five-second-rule" refers to the necessary time to elapse after spending mana before mana regeneration will resume.
- **A "tick" is a measure of time used for over-time effects. Mana regeneration uses 2-second "ticks".
